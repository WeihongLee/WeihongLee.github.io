        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">Around three years ago (2014) when I was the third year graduate student at Sun Yat-Sen University, I was a very fat guy (75kg). I started to go to the gym at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies in order to reduce my weight. With a year's training, I failed.</p>

        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">In 2015, I got admission from the Sun Yat-Sen University for further pursuing the master degree. At that time, I was the final year graduate student. I was so confused and tried my best to figure out how to built the muscle efficiently.</p>

        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">After 6 months hard working, I reduced my weight to 70kg. But I found I was not fit enough (shape and curve).</p>

        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">In addition to this, I felt very tedious and tired. In stead of treating workout as a task, I changed to form it as a habbit with my brother's suggestions. From then on, I go to the gym regularly (4-5 times a week) without any bad feeling and trained systematically.</p>
        </div>

        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">In the meanwhile, I read some books and blog about fitness, where I knew some super stars Lazar, Simon Panda and James Grage, who had a very great impact on my fitness career. Also, I learned something from my young brother.</p>

        &nbsp;

        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">I knew, fitness is not simple. It is the combination of exercise, supplymentation and rest. As a popular saying goes, if you want to be in shape, you need to 'train like a beast, eat like a horse and sleep like a baby'.</p>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="text-align:center"><img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="pipeline picture" src="https://WeiHongLee.github.io/images/Fitness-Reading/4-min.jpeg" style="width:60%"></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">With three years of experience on fitness, I become stronger phisically and mentally. In each training day, I would test which strategy or exercise is the best for a specific piece of muscle. From 2016, I became a fitness trainer to help other students in our ISEE Lab to be in shape or reduce fat. I am very glad to see most of members in our team do regular exercise now and gained a significant success this year. Besides, with the constant training, I am fit now and I am able to do the human flag! I believe, I will be able to do the front level in 2018.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="text-align:center"><img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="pipeline picture" src="https://WeiHongLee.github.io/images/Fitness-Reading/3-min.jpeg" style="width:60%"></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">In Oct. 2017, I got an oppotunity to conduct the visiting Ph.D. study to involve in the Royal Newton Project at Queen Mary University of London in the UK. I kept regular exercise in the gym, which is just on the first floor of our lab building, or trained in the park. Although the weather is very cold here in comparison with that in GuangZhou, the environment here is extremely nice. I believe I will keep doing exercise at any place, in any time.</p>

        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">Beyond to fitness, I kept regular reading, which is a bridge to knowledge.</p>

        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">Apart from research and fitness, I hope I can own a excellent study with a vast quantity of books, spacious space as well as classy chairs, table and furniture. It will be a extremely leisure time to read a book with a very nice cup of tea in such comfy environment. It is also a extremely great place to share Kongfu Tea with my family and friends. By the way, my faviourite tea is Red Tea from Yunnan Province and Dancong Tea from my hometown.</p>
