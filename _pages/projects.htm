            <!--<p class="lead">Humans can easily recognize the importance of people in social event images, and they always focus on the most important individuals. However, learning to learn the relation between people in an image, and inferring the most important person based on this relation, remains undeveloped. In this work, we propose a deep imPOrtance relatIon NeTwork (POINT) that combines both relation modeling and feature learning. In particular, we infer two types of interaction modules: the person-person interaction module that learns the interaction between people and the event-person interaction module that learns to describe how a person is involved in the event occurring in an image. We then estimate the importance relations among people from both interactions and encode the relation feature from the importance relations. In this way, POINT automatically learns several types of relation features in parallel and we aggregate these relation features and the person's feature to form the importance feature for important people classification.</p>-->

            <!--<p class="lead">Person re-identification (re-id) is to match people across disjoint camera views in a multi-camera system, and re-id has been an important technology applied in smart city in recent years. However, the majority of existing person re-id methods are not designed for processing sequential data in an online way. This ignores the real-world scenario that person images detected from multi-cameras system are coming sequentially. While there is a few work on discussing online re-id, most of them require considerable storage of all passed data samples that have been ever observed, and this could be unrealistic for processing data from a large camera network. In this work, we present an onepass person re-id model that adapts the re-id model based on each newly observed data and no passed data are directly used for each update. More specifically, we develop an Sketch online Discriminant Analysis (SoDA) by embedding sketch processing into Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA). SoDA can efficiently keep the main data variations of all passed samples in a low rank matrix when processing sequential data samples, and estimate the approximate within-class variance (i.e. within-class covariance matrix) from the sketch data information. We provide theoretical analysis on the effect of the estimated approximate within-class covariance matrix. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the Fisher discriminant score (i.e. the quotient between between-class variation and within-class variation after feature transformation) in order to investigate how the optimal feature transformation learned by SoDA sequentially approximates the offline FDA that is learned on all observed data. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our SoDA and empirically support our theoretical analysis.</p>-->

            <!--<p class="lead">Always, some individuals in images are more important/attractive than others in some events such as presentation, basketball game or speech. However, it is challenging to find important people among all individuals in images directly based on their spatial or appearance information due to the existence of diverse variations of pose, action, appearance of persons and various changes of occasions. We overcome this difficulty by constructing a multiple Hyper-Interaction Graph to treat each individual in an image as a node and inferring the most active node referring to interactions estimated by various types of clews. We model pairwise interactions between persons as the edge message communicated between nodes, resulting in a bidirectional pairwise-interaction graph. To enrich the personperson interaction estimation, we further introduce a unidirectional hyper-interaction graph that models the consensus of interaction between a focal person and any person in a local region around. Finally, we modify the PageRank algorithm to infer the activeness of persons on the multiple Hybrid-Interaction Graph (HIG), the union of the pairwise-interaction and hyperinteraction graphs, and we call our algorithm the <I><B>PersonRank</I></B>. In order to provide publicable datasets for evaluation, we have contributed a new dataset called Multi-scene Important People Image Dataset and gathered a NCAA Basketball Image Dataset from sports game sequences. We have demonstrated that the proposed PersonRank outperforms related methods clearly and substantially.</p>-->
